Only if you set client authentication by password (in params.js exports.useClientPassword = true; is set)
create connection password to fhem.js by the following shell command:

echo -n "my password" | sha256sum | cut -d' ' -f1 > /etc/fhem.js/pw_client_auth

(replace "my Password" to a password of your choice)
